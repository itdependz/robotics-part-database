# Robotics Inventory Management System (RIMS)
## The Problem
The major problem in robotics teams is keeping track of what parts are available and what parts arenâ€™t. When a robotics team starts building a robot, they often underestimate the amount of parts required to make it and soon come to realize that they need to order more parts. By this time its already too late as competition time is right around the corner. This Robotics Inventory Management System (RIMS) helps robotics teams eliminate the stress and allow them to be able to predict when a part is about to run out.
